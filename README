wp-latestpost-short
Wordpress plugin

This plugin adds the shorttag [latest_post] which allows you to show 
the latest post on a static page (e.g. your static front page).

Just put [latest_post] where you want it displayed.

It's formatted as follows.

	<div class='latest'> 
	<p class='title'><a href='http://example.com/the-permalink/'>The title</a></p> 
	<p class='content'>The Content</p>
	</div>

If there is no posts it will output 

	<div class='latest'>No latest post found</div>

	Scroll down through the list of Plugins to find the newly installed Plugin (if not visible, start from the beginning to check to see if you followed the instructions properly and uploaded the file correctly).
